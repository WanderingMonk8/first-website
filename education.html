                <h2>A Dream to Unlock the Potential of Modern Education</h2>
                <p>I have spent close to a decade in international education in China. To further discuss my vision for edcuation, it is necessary to expand this term. International education in China stands as an alternative pathway to the mainstream education system. Roughly it can be defined as education with the ultimate goal to study abroad. As a field, it alone confers no standard of educational theory or methodology. But it is also because of the lack of industrial standards, there was a wide breadth of experimentation and innovation. When I was the academic principal of an international high school, that was exactly what I set myself to do - to create an education that can unlock students' full potentials. </p>
                <h2>What Are the Main Challenges of Education Today?</h2>
                <p>The main difficulties in creating a modern education can be summarized into one word - motivation. Or rather, the lack of motivation. It is no secret that the mainstream Chinese education is mainly focused on rote memorization and absolute obedience to authority. As a result, most students lie in between the extremes of efficient test-taking machines and thoroughly disengaged laggards. Everything else - from the increasing numbers of student depression and even suicides, to the deepening inequality between winners and losers - stems from this distrophy of students' inherent motivation to learn.</p>
                <h2>An Education that is Self Motivating</h2>
                <p>How to create an education that solves in central issue? I believe that we must re-align the inputs and outputs of education around student interests. In other words, the instructions and assessments of student learning must come from what students are interested in the larger world, and not dictated by teachers. The key difficulties in doing this, is how to effectively organize the 5Ws of the learning process - the "who, what, when, where, why", across the multitude of students. </p>
                <h2>From Conveyor Belt to World Map Education</h2>
                <p>In the past century, our education system has rarely deviated from the Conveyor belt model to deliver the 5Ws of learning. Our teachers decide the topic, the timeline, the contents, the delivery methods and assessments in this educational model. It is no wonder that there will always be winners and losers in education. My educational theory is to instead turn education to a world map of discovery and exploration, by using a student-directed project based learning, where they begin with what they want to explore, and teachers work with them to design learning projects that are aligned with their learning objectives. </p>
