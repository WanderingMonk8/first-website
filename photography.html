                <h2>A Solo Journey through the Lens</h2>
                <p>My discovery for the love of photography came when I began taking strolls in the streets at night while I was living in Shenzhen, China. It began as the part of the night with just myself and my thoughts. But soon I could not detach myself from all the souls of the city's streets. It was at night when people would all slow down, to see and be seen. Some would mill around some open-door restaurants, stores, or anywhere well lit, like lingering moths. Some would stroll through the streets, in no hurry to anywhere, alone or in pairs. Sometimes, there might be a soul or two, frozen alone in thoughts, in reminiscence or in dreams. All those moments of minds distilled in the quiet of the night. At first I only bore witness to them, letting them be part of my own thoughts. But pretty soon I began to snap photos of them with my phone. </p>
                <h2>The Process of Street Photography</h2>
                <p>The exciting thing about street photography is about the final photos as much as the process of taking them. They say in street photography, shyness is always the first hurdle to get over. And in the beginning, I prefer shooting at night in part due to the secrecy of my photography process. When I come upon a subject that really grabs my attention, I quickly compose the mental image while approaching him or her. Raising my phone to my hip, I would pause momentarily, snap the photo, and move on as just another passerby. While I might have gotten more thick-skinned over time, and even attempted some more confrontational shooting techniques, I always prefer my subjects undisturbed. </p>
                <h2>In Search of a Style</h2>
                <p>In terms of style, I prefer larger, structural shots - probably in part due to the limitation of my phone's 25mm lens. But it's always about people, or in some cases, the absence of people. Composition is always in the back of my head, but it is the story, the emotion, of the moment that I am after. Lights and colors also form the back drop of my photos. Though I do not have a very strict theoretical rule about lights and colors, they help form a deeper tonal mood, and therefore, a better way to my storytelling. And this is where the streets of China can best shine through, for many of the Chinese cities I have been, they are vibrant and vivid even past midnight. Though I admit, that for a while I was tempted by the "pretty Instagram" asthaetics of highly stylized, composed photos. But in moments of loss, I always remember to find the "heart" of the street photography. </p>
